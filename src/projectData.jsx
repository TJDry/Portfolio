        "Although this wont be possible for a period of time, we have started to formally implement it partially as a theme and are waiting on the suppliers to get back to us with the new theme. For this theme I was given the old theme plus a BMW design and given the colour scheme, I utilised this similar layout whilst also combining it with aspects of more modern gradient logos with dropshadows.",
        "I created a clean design for multiple sections of the software, keeping it simple with no bezels or embossing and making sure its easily accessible and usable whilst also keeping it within reason of an upgrade. I also created a dynamic resting page with multiple gradients to help promote a cleaner and more modern creative look, with gradient bubbles blurred out to create distance between the sharper time and the background colours",

        "The app utilises BLE technology to hold up to 4 devices at the same time. It requires a full scale app with all tests, results and report creation as this is an industry standard application usable by the public. To start this project I was presented with an underdeveloped version of the app and the inspiration behind it. From here I researched similar apps and created a list of necessary features that the app should include to be successful.",
        "I then went on to do design & colour palette research, with the original colour palette being shown as RGB green and red.I researched popular trends and display types for graphs, navigations and data presentation and created a first mockup of the app. From here I utilised Figma to create a fully mocked up prototype after receiving consistent feedback from peers and improving the design of the app to the point where it has 3 new versions that are refined each time.",
        "Once the app design was mostly finalised, I was tasked to find a suitable development team to develop the app. So I began the interview process via upwork and filtered through the many applicants for the project and ended up interviewing 4 development teams. From those 4 teams, we tested one, who never responded and thus we re-interviewed a couple and are waiting for project approval from my boss for the project to go ahead as we received the communication medium for the BLE device.",
        "Since those interviews I have been slowly improving the app's UI integrating a better navigation and sizings both for button and text and refining the BattWatcher brand."

      "It's an all-in-one inclusive app that uses our OBD2 Scanner to connect your phone to the car via Bluetooth and manage the codes, test various aspects of your vehicle and help to maintain your car & keep it working at its full potential. OBD2 is the physical port where devices can connect to a car's ECU and provide insight into errors and statistics present in the ECU. Our tools utilise the port and decode specific data through calculations named PIDs.As I was handed this project halfway, existing designs for the app were unable to be modified and thus having to stick with the current design style for the new screens I needed to create to finish the app's designs. It's a large-scale app with many APIs and calculations that need to be functional before release.The complexity of this app makes it hard to communicate and clarify functionality with the outsourced dev team responsible to produce the app",
      "It has been a long and hard year long project, with over 40 APK builds and adjustments. From adding new features to refining performance and functionality, it becomes hard to tell if the project is making any haste towards production level.",
      "The project needs to be able to run smoothly across all android versions making it hard for the developers i manage communications with to develop the app in a way that can run smoothly on all",
